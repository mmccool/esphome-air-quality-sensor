# ESPHome Air Quality Sensor
POE Air Quality Sensor based on ESPHome, works with Home Assistant.
Built around WESP32, powered by POE.  Does not support WiFi (but it would be a pretty easy change).
Computes AQI using PM data.
Radio is used as a bluetooth Proxy (allowing, for example, access to data from nearby Inkbird temperature sensors).

To do: 
- Document required hardware BOM
- Add a gas sensor for CO, Ozone, VOC, etc.
